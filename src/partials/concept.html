                    <p class="concept__text">It all begins with your idea. Whether it's a concept in your head, a rough
                        sketch, or a collection of inspirations, this is where our collaboration starts. During our
                        initial
                        one-on-one consultation, we'll dive deep into what you want to create, discussing everything
                        from
                        the desired silhouette and function to the specific story you want your piece to tell.</p>

                    <h3 class="concept__lititle">The Design & Blueprint</h3>
                    <p class="concept__text">Once we understand your vision, our designers get to work translating your
                        ideas into detailed sketches and digital mockups. This is a collaborative phase where you'll see
                        your concept take its first visual form and have the opportunity to provide feedback. We will
                        refine
                        the design together until every element, from the fabric choice to the smallest hardware detail,
                        is
                        absolutely perfect.</p>

                    <h3 class="concept__lititle">The Art of the Craft</h3>
                    <p class="concept__text">This is where the magic happens. Our skilled artisans take the approved
                        design
                        and bring it into the physical world. Using premium, carefully sourced materials and precision
                        techniques, we meticulously cut, stitch, and construct your garment. We focus on durability and
                        a
                        flawless finish, ensuring your custom piece is not only stylish but also built to last.</p>

                <li class="concept__item">
                    <h3 class="concept__lititle">Your One-of-One Is Ready</h3>
                    <p class="concept__text">The final and most exciting step is getting your unique creation into your
                        hands. Your finished piece is carefully inspected, professionally packaged, and delivered to
                        you.
                        This isn't just another item of clothing; it's a one-of-one garment that represents your
                        personal
                        narrative and style, crafted with zero compromises.</p>
